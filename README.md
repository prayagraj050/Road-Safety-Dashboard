#  Road Safety Analysis Dashboard

It focuses on analyzing road accident data using **Power BI** to uncover accident trends, risk factors, and actionable insights.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

* Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** analyzing accident patterns from a dataset of \~300,000 records.
* Designed KPIs and visuals to highlight severity, time trends, weather conditions, road surfaces, and junction control.
* Added slicers, bookmarks, and collapsible filter panes for intuitive navigation.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Accident Severity Distribution** (Slight, Serious, Fatal)
* **Accidents Over Time** (daily, monthly, and hourly trends)
* **Day-of-Week Analysis**
* **Weather Conditions vs Severity**
* **Road Surface Conditions vs Severity**
* **Top Junction Controls Contributing to Accidents**
* **Interactive Slicers & Bookmarks** for dynamic filtering
* **KPI Cards** for total accidents, casualties, fatalities, and vehicles involved

---

## 💡 Insights

* **Peak accident hours**: morning and evening rush periods
* **Weekends vs weekdays**: higher late-evening incidents on weekends
* **Weather impact**: wet/icy surfaces strongly correlate with severe accidents
* **Junction control**: uncontrolled junctions have disproportionately high accident rates
* **Urban vs Rural**: urban areas see more accidents, but rural accidents are often more severe
